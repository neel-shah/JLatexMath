To build the jlatexmath library just type ant...
The default task is "buildJar", the others are :
  - source;
  - plugin;
  - embedded;
  - src-all;
  - plugin-src;
  - clean;
  - minimal (for GeoGebra or web applications), dist/jlatexmath-minimal.zip will be created 

For the moment, the doc is very poor ... It will come in a closed future ...
But I wrote some examples to show how to use easily the library.

Have fun and if you meet a problem, don't hesitate to write me at :
